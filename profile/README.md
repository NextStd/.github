# NextStd

> Working toward a safer standard library for the next generation

**NextStd** is an experimental effort to explore safer, well-defined, and modern alternatives to traditional C standard library components. The project focuses on correctness, explicit behavior, and performance, while remaining practical for real-world systems and embedded use.

This is a work in progress. APIs, guarantees, and scope may evolve as the project matures.

## Libraries Implemented

1. [`ns_io`](https://github.com/NextStd/ns_io) : An alternative to `stdio.h`
